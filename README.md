# Groovy's Loose Typing and Null/Empty String Handling

This example demonstrates a potential issue in Groovy related to its loose typing system and how it interacts with null and empty string comparisons.  While the null check is explicit, the difference between null and empty strings can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly accounted for.

The `bug.groovy` file shows an example of the problem, while `bugSolution.groovy` offers a solution.

This issue highlights the importance of being mindful when handling strings, especially when dealing with scenarios involving potential null values in Groovy.
